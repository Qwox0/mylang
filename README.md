# mylang

My programming language (TODO: think of a good name; this is always the hardest part)

> [!WARNING]
> This programming language is currently a hobby side project. Therefore, I don't have the time to manage and accept contributions. This also allows me to have full control over the design of the language. (There are other languages where too many different opinions have led to bad decisions.)
> Additionally, during early development, there are no guarantees for backward compatibility.

## Development plan

- [ ] Implement the basic language with very few features (to avoid design flaws)
- [ ] Design and implement a coherent concept of language and its more complicated features.
- [ ] Slow down development and use the language to identify real problems
- [ ] Finish the main aspects and features of the language
- [ ] ...

## Inspirations

While collecting ideas for this language, I thought about and developed concepts for many different features. After some time, I realized that most of my ideas were already implemented in the following languages (especially in Jai), and usually in a better way.

* [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
* Jai (Jonathan Blow's language)
* [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig)
* [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin)
